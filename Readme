Hello Team

1. Kindly run the npm i in the package.json path
2. look the config.txt, which is used to dynamically add the URL for scrapping 
3. run npm start
4. As of now I made the puppeeter as headless true. So it silently do the action.
5. If we need to do any authentication like MFA, we can run headless as false and do while scrapping.
